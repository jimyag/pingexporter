# pingexporter

Pingexporter is a project that allows you to monitor the availability and latency of network hosts using ICMP ping requests.

It collects ping metrics and generates detailed reports for analysis.

This tool draws inspiration from both the [ping_exporter](https://github.com/czerwonk/ping_exporter) and [SmokePing](https://github.com/oetiker/SmokePing) repositories, combining their strengths and introducing additional enhancements.

Please note that the project is still in its early stages of development, and there may be some issues or incomplete documentation.
